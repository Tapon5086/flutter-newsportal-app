## 🧪 Testing

To test the app locally:

```bash
flutter test
```

Or run it on an emulator or device:

```bash
flutter run
```

To test with Firebase Emulator:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
flutter run
```

## 💡 How It Works

* **Authentication**: Users login with email/password via Firebase Auth.
* **News Fetching**: App pulls news data using an API or from Firebase Firestore.
* **Offline Support**: Firebase Emulator allows testing locally without a live Firebase instance.
* **State Management**: Uses `Provider` or simple `setState` (depending on implementation).
* **UI**: Flutter’s widget tree renders real-time updates with smooth transitions.
